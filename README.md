# Savr.ai ‚Äî Autonomous Meal Planning

Savr.ai scans grocery receipts and turns purchases into personalized, actionable meal plans. Designed for a fast hackathon demo, this repo contains a responsive React frontend, serverless AWS backend (Lambda + API Gateway), receipt OCR (Textract), and AI reasoning (Amazon Bedrock / Claude).

Live demo: https://savr-ai-one.vercel.app

Quick highlights

- Upload a grocery receipt (image / PDF)
- Parse items & prices with Textract
- Enrich and reason about groceries with Bedrock (Claude)
- Generate weekly meal plans tailored to diet, allergies, budget
- Session-based lightweight user persistence (no third-party auth required for demo)

---

## Features

- **Receipt Scanning** - Extracts purchased items using **Amazon Textract**
- **AI Reasoning Engine** - Generates meal plans via **Claude 4.5** on **Amazon Bedrock**
- **Agent Orchestration** - Uses **Bedrock AgentCore** for reasoning and tool calling
- **Data Management** - Stores user profiles, receipts, and meal plans in **DynamoDB**
- **Serverless Backend** - Built with **AWS Lambda** and **API Gateway**
- **Frontend Dashboard** - Responsive **React + Vite + Vercel** web app
- **Monitoring & Analytics** - **CloudWatch** and **X-Ray** for logging

## What‚Äôs in this repository

- `frontend/` ‚Äî React + Vite single-page app (Dashboard, MealPlan, ReceiptScan)
- `backend/` ‚Äî Lambda handlers (receipt parsing, upload, analyze, preferences)
- `infra/` ‚Äî AWS CDK stacks (S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, IAM)

---

## Architecture (high level)

1. Frontend uploads receipts via presigned S3 URLs (Lambda generates URL)
2. Textract (via `parse_receipt` Lambda) extracts items/prices from the receipt
3. AI analysis Lambda (`analyze_receipt_ai`) calls Amazon Bedrock (Claude) to produce categories, recipes, health & budget insights
4. Meal planning generation uses Bedrock and stores plans in DynamoDB

## Quickstart ‚Äî Run locally (Frontend)

1. Install dependencies and run frontend locally

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# opens on http://localhost:5173 by default (Vite)
```

2. For quick development without deploying backend, the frontend has safe fallbacks and mocked flows. To run end-to-end, you‚Äôll need access to the deployed API Gateway and S3/DynamoDB resources (or run CDK locally and deploy).

---

## API (important endpoints)

Base URL: set `VITE_API_URL` in `frontend/.env` or rely on the fallback configured in `frontend/src/services/api.js`.

- POST `/upload` ‚Äî Request a presigned S3 URL. Body: `{ fileName, contentType, userId }` ‚Üí returns `{ uploadUrl, s3Key }`
- POST `/parse-receipt` ‚Äî Parse an uploaded receipt. Body: `{ s3Key, userId }` ‚Üí returns parsed items
- POST `/analyze-receipt` ‚Äî Bedrock-powered AI analysis. Body: `{ s3Key, userId }` ‚Üí returns insights, recipe suggestions, budget analysis
- POST `/generate-plan` ‚Äî Generate a meal plan from preferences. Body: `{ preferences, userId }`
- GET `/meal-plan` ‚Äî Fetch stored meal plan by `userId`

If you hit a 404 for `/upload` or other endpoints, confirm `VITE_API_URL` points to the correct API Gateway stage URL.

## Development notes & design decisions (for judges)

- Session-based lightweight user identification (no strict auth) to keep the demo friction-free
- Serverless-first architecture for rapid iteration and low-cost demo hosting
- Uses Bedrock Claude for high-level reasoning and recipe suggestions ‚Äî decoupled from OCR pipeline so each piece can be demonstrated independently

---

## How to present (2‚Äì3 minute flow for judges)

1. Open the frontend (Vercel preview / local dev)
2. Show the Dashboard and preference settings
3. Click Upload receipt ‚Üí pick a photo of a grocery receipt
4. Demonstrate parsing (Textract) and AI insights (Claude) and the generated meal suggestions
5. Generate a meal plan and show it rendered with MealCard grid
